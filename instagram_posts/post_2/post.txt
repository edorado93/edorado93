Opened over a century ago in 1907, Pike Place Market is a must-visit if you go to Seattle.

It sits right above Elliott Bay and is one of the city’s most iconic spots, filled with local vendors, fresh seafood, flower stalls, and small shops that have been around for decades.

You’ll likely catch the famous fish toss at the fish market, a long-standing tradition that started as a way for vendors to work more efficiently and has since become part of the market’s identity.

Pike Place is lively and can get quite busy throughout the day, but it’s still doable for wheelchair users.

Grab some chowder or fish n’ chips (or both), wander around, and enjoy a market that’s been a core part of the Emerald City for generations.

Also worth noting, just steps away you’ll find the original Starbucks location. Nearby, the Seattle Waterfront offers views of the bay and access to boat tours like Argosy Cruises.

Pike Place Market and other key spots around Seattle were visited by Wheel the World mappers. They went on-site to measure the details that actually matter and take photos, so travelers with disabilities can see what to expect before they arrive.
