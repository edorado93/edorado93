COMING DEC. 6: @soundtransit is opening three new Link light rail stations on December 6, making it easier than ever to get between Federal Way and Seattle! 

The brand new 1 Line stations south of Angle Lake each: 

🚍 Support easy transfers to & from @kcmetrobus buses and other regional transit services. (Like @piercetransit buses and ST Express!) 

🚲 Feature pickup and drop-off zones for people walking, biking, or arriving on paratransit and other modes. 

🚘 Have parking spaces available to park and ride. 

Getting to Seattle on the light rail is a great way to skip the traffic and avoid the stress of finding parking, especially downtown or during big events at stadiums! (Looking at you #FIFAWorldCup 👀)
