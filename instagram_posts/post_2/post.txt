💐 Happy birthday to our beloved @pikeplacepublicmarket! Since 1907, Pike Place Market has believed in bringing fresh goods directly from local farmers to consumers. Since then, it has built a strong community of farmers, makers, and artists that welcomes millions of locals and visitors each year! Cheers to 117 years of unforgettable memories and many more to come!
