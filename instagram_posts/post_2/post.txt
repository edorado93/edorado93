Have you ever been to Seattle? This is your sign to visit! It sits between the water and the mountains, and with its distinct neighborhoods and strong food scene, travelers can experience it all.

Maggie and Brad visited Seattle for the first time, and as two wheelchair users, they explored how the city works from an accessibility standpoint. Across many of the key areas and attractions, they found spaces that were both navigable and welcoming to disabled travelers.

These included the famous Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, The Waterfront and Argosy Cruises, and more. 

And now, Seattle is an Accessibility Verified destination! This means expert mappers have gone on-site to assess hotels, attractions, and restaurants. That information is turned into detailed, accurate listings, so travelers with disabilities can plan trips knowing what to expect before they arrive.
