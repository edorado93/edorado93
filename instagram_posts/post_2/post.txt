Celebrate this holiday season at @seattlecenter with the magical #winterfest! Delight in viewing a late 19th-century model train and village display, installed inside the Armory Food & Event Hall. Bring your family and friends to enjoy an interactive scavenger hunt and see how many clues you can spot! The Winter & Train Village is free and open to the public but donations are accepted to keep the train operating.
