Over the last month, Seattle and the surrounding area have welcomed a few new residents that are making a larger than life impression on all who come across them. Northwest Trolls: The Way of the Bird King features six giant hand-built troll sculptures by Danish environmental artist, @thomasdambo. Each troll is accessible to the public and free to view. Embark on an adventure to find them in their new homes!
