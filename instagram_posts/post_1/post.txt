My kids have seen a lot of concerts/theater, but it’s still a stretch outing 😬.

I got lots of recent requests AND suggestions for tips on how to make a cultural outing successful when I asked a few weeks ago. Here are some tips to save (I need them too):

𝘼𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚

1️⃣ Pick a show designed for kids. Many theaters provide an age rec & they’re usually spot-on +/- a year. Choosing a time slot that works with things like nap/bedtime also helps!

2️⃣ Choose the right seat. We like the tiered boxes at Benaroya Hall (all family concert 🎟️ are the same price) and you recommended gallery seats at McCaw Hall. Picking an end gives you a quick exit. Purchase early for best availability. 

3️⃣ Prep the program in advance. This could be watching a 🎥, listening to the 🎼, reading the story or attending an abridged version (i.e., @evergreencityballet has a 1-hr version of the Nutcracker).

4️⃣ Pack: 🎧 for sound-sensitive or younger kids, water bottles and quiet snacks/toys if allowed or for intermission.

5️⃣ Review show etiquette - sitting in seats, minimal whispering, applauding after the performance

6️⃣ Eat beforehand so everyone’s full and happy!

7️⃣ Arrive early for pre-show activities, use the 🚻 & grab a booster cushion if available.

8️⃣ Plan the “after party.” Will you eat lunch nearby after the show? If it’s close to bedtime, can you wear festive PJs or pack them in the car?

9️⃣ Reiterate etiquette when necessary

🔟 Kids will be kids, but exit if behavior becomes too disruptive. Places like @sct_seattle have quiet rooms you can retreat to, and some theaters will let you come back in if you need a break.

1️⃣1️⃣ Maybe it’ll take you a year to recover and do it again, maybe you’ll book another show in the car ride home, but celebrate! You exposed your kid to the arts!

👉 What would you add? What show are you attending with kids this season?
