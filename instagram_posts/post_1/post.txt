Christmas lights add a vibrant, festive sparkle to the holiday season. @downtownseattle has brought the holidays to the heart of downtown Seattle! Weâ€™ve collected some of our favorite displays here in one spot for you to enjoy or try for yourself. Capture the perfect selfie under larger-than-life light sculptures in Westlake Park, and enjoy family-friendly activities at Westlake and Occidental Square every weekend. All events are free and open to the public! Click the link in our bio to learn more.
