@eighthgeneration is a Seattle based art and lifestyle brand that is owned by the Snoqualmie Tribe. Founded in 2008, it is the first Native-owned company to ever produce wool blankets. They focus on the artist-centric approach and have 100% Native designed products. Make sure to stop by their store in downtown Seattle right near Pike Place Market!
