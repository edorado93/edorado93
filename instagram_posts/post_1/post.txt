Whether taking a scenic tour or flying to the San Juan Islands, enjoying the journey is easy when your mode of transportation is a seaplane! Pro tip: if you're not able to fit a seaplane ride into your visit, you can watch them land and take off on Lake Union from nearby South Lake Union or Gas Works Park.
