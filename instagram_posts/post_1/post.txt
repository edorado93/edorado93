This is your reminder that all National Parks have free entrance this Sunday, August 4! Seattle is perfectly situated within a few hours of 3 gorgeous National Parksâ€”the perfect day trip from the city! 

ðŸŒ²Pro tips: Mount Rainier National Park still requires a reservation through September 2 and as always, be sure to check for any closures due to weather, construction, etc. before heading out!
