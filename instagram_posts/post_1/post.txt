Gardens aren't the only things blooming in Seattle! Located along Alki Avenue in West Seattle, this colorful beach house and the matching one directly next door (a.k.a. the Flower Houses) have become well-known among locals and delight all who discover them. ðŸŒ¸

Pro Tip: the best time to pass by is in June when the flowers are in full bloom.
