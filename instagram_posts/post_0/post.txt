have you taken the seattle water taxi before? 

if not, this 6-mile urban hiking route around west seattle that starts and ends in downtown has you covered @visitseattle 

whether you’re just visiting or you live in seattle, west seattle can sometimes feel out of the way, but don’t let that stop you from exploring its beauty and beachy, laid-back vibes with one of the best seattle skyline views

save this route as inspiration for your next urban hike and use the link in my bio to view the route on @strava and google (with marked location recs)

happy urban hiking !

** ferry avenue can be a climb, so i’d recommend taking california avenue if you’re looking for something more gradual
