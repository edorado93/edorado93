With engaging exhibitions highlighting pop culture, Seattle's legendary music scene, and more, @mopopseattle is also home to incredible spaces and art features like this two-story sculpture made out of over 500 instruments.

Pro tip: receive half off admission to MoPOP and many more of Seattle's worldclass museums in February during #SeattleMuseumMonth when staying at a participating downtown Seattle hotel. See the link in our bio for more details!
