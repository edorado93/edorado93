The Seattle area and Puget Sound region have been home to Indigenous tribes for generations. These communities are still here, and we honor the people past and present who belong to this place. Join us in celebrating #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth by learning more about the Native community in and around Seattle, discover and support Native-owned businesses and artists, and explore resources, reading lists, exhibitions, and more.
