It's a beautiful time of year to explore the forests and mountains surrounding Seattle! Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest is under an hour-and-a-half from Seattle by car. View the link in our bio for ideas on trails to explore, and always remember to check the weather forecast, road conditions, and closures before taking off on your adventure!
